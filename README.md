# Hangman Game

Welcome to the classic Hangman game implemented in Python! This simple text-based game challenges players to guess letters and uncover a hidden word before running out of attempts. It's a fun way to test your word-guessing skills and improve your Python programming knowledge.

## Features

- Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
- Players guess letters one at a time to reveal the hidden word.
- Displays the current progress and remaining attempts.
- Encourages players to think strategically to avoid running out of guesses.

## How to Play

1. Run the `hangman.py` script using Python.
2. The game will display the number of letters in the hidden word.
3. Guess letters one by one.
4. If the guessed letter is correct, it will appear in the word.
5. If the guess is incorrect, you lose one attempt.
6. Continue guessing until you reveal the word or run out of attempts.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
